In this work, we\\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.\", 'categories': ['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG'], 'published': '2025-10-10T17:57:04+00:00'}, 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09596v1': {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09596v1', 'title': 'BaNEL: Exploration Posteriors for Generative Modeling Using Only Negative Rewards', 'authors': ['Sangyun Lee', 'Brandon Amos', 'Giulia Fanti'], 'summary': \"Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and\\ninformative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation.

This setting poses a fundamentally different learning\\nchallenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose\\nBaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the\\nmodel using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward\\nevaluations (NREs).

Jha'], 'summary': 'Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)\\napplications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide\\nabstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of\\nthe two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not\\nrealized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In\\naddition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural\\napproaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a\\ngold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the\\nsymbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora\\nhas remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing\\nGraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs\\nfrom unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT\\nand its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of\\nabstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the\\nfirst efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art\\nbenchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to\\nbaselines.\\n  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual\\n(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with\\ndomain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,\\nQwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to\\nprompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On\\ntext obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT\\nyields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG\\nthat achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher\\nValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.', 'categories': ['cs.AI', 'cs.CL'], 'published': '2025-10-10T17:36:14+00:00'}}\n",
