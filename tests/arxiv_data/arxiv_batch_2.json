    "summary": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to demonstrate\nquantum utility on near-term quantum computers. However, these algorithms often\nget executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best\nperformance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs\ncan be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on\nto still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that\ncarefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using\nour technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve\nclose to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use\nNest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3)\nincreasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three\nconflicting metrics simultaneously.",

    "summary": "Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as\nmath and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding\ncontrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such\nas web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human\ncognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -\nthe capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order\nto enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive\nenvironments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that\nexplicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their\nreasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which\ntrains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search\ntrees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.\nReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips\nit with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,\nwe propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further\nstrengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both\noutcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.\nExperiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one\nrealistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively\ninfuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome\nand interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,\nplanning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of\nsimulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in\nthe ever more challenging environments.",

We present a biologically inspired,\nActive Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning\n(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within\na single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses\ntopological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide\nbehaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns\nstate transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free\nEnergy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We\nimplemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and\nrobot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It\noperates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports\nboth exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We\ndemonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments\nagainst state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's\nadaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor\nnoise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,\nself-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at\nhttps://github.com/decide-ugent/AIMAPP.",

Solving such\nproblems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models\nis increasing.

Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event\nsequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's\nability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a\nsignificant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an\nincrease in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target\nmetric.",

    "summary": "Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures\nthat modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new\nmodality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,\nmulti-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its\nresponse as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We\nintroduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that\nenables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights\ndirectly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters\non-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each\ndiffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables\nthe model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying\nconditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through\nexperiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,\nparametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to\nspatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA\nestablishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy\nis modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing\ncontrol to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.",

This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by\nImpact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a\nrobot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our\napproach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from\nanimal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy\nefficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport\n(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.",

However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or\ntask-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because\ntheir intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard\npolicy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence\nlower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant\npolicy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy\nGradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true\nlog-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines\nbased on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy\nover state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,\n18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.",

To address this gap,\nwe introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates\nhuman-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing\nbehavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five\ndownstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,\nmathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that\ntypos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and\nthose requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is\ncomparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance\nbut may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent\nrobustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource\nones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into\nEnglish. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and\nmultilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly\navailable.",
