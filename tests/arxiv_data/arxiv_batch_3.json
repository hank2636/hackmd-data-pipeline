    "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier\nReward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause\noverthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.\nPrior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while\noften harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of\ntoken-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of\nsupervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and\npropose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to\nregularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments\nare strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design\na length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without\nheavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.\nMoreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model\nsizes.",

    "summary": "We propose a generative multivariate posterior sampler via flow matching. It\noffers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood\nevaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the\njoint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport\nmap from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named\nvector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It\nis advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the\nvelocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,\nenabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose\ncontours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach\nis computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based\ncounterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.\nFinally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered\nposterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is\nprovided.",

Our approach integrates (1)\na generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a\nsemi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to\nidentify relevant information for specific downstream objectives. This dual\ngenerative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and\ntask-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the\nmissing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources.\nThe potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal\nclinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the\ncomplex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic\nmodalities.",

    "summary": "Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable\nmanagement of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models\noften fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the\ninherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This\ngeneralization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples\navailable for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a\ngeo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water\ntemperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major\ninnovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which\nleverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and\npatterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware\nembedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design\nenables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by\ngeographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.\nWe evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which\nis a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37\nyears across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,\nGeo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both\nregions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results\nhighlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental\nmonitoring and decision-making.",

    "summary": "Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing\nrequires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial\nshear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental\nprotocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample\nmanipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced\ntissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue\nbehavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention\nto the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation\nproblem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the\nautomated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter\nidentification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a\nBayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We\nshowcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the\nmaterial model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single\nheterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the\nground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work\nhighlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic\nmaterial models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty\nquantification.",

    "summary": "In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube\ncalled a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the\npatient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,\naneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance\nmaneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.\nAutomation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome\nthese challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular\nnavigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown\npromising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning\nframework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic\ncontrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire\nnavigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different\nmodular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under\nsimulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular\ngeometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the\naneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,\noutperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline\nstudies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection\nchoice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/",

We build on previous work that successfully\ndesigned site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture\nmodels (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a\nvector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key\ndrawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to\nthe feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE\nallows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot\noptimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable\nperformance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional\nmethods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and\niterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized\nby fewer pilots or feedback bits.",

    "summary": "Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population\nis thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney\nfunction to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney\ndamage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are\ncrucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning\nmodels can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an\nenormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector\nnowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction\ncapability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive\ncomputer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is\nattained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing\nvalues; those are filled in using \"mean-mode\" and \"Random sampling method\"\nstrategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques\n(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision\nTree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance\nevaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the\ntechniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy.

    "summary": "We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns\nfrom offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online\nwithout access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of\nonline interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We\naddress these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and\nestablish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under\ngeneral function approximations for both expert data and reward-free\ninteractions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result\nthat can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and\ntherefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with\nsecond-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed\nhard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample\ncomplexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited\nexpert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in\nterms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy\nvariance $\\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and\ndemonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the\nsample efficiency of existing methods.",
